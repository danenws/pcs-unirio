Definitions
A noun is a word or set of words for a person, place, thing, or idea.
A noun of more than one word (tennis court, gas station) is called a compound noun.
There are common nouns and proper nouns.
Common nouns are words for a general class of people, places, things, and ideas (man, city, award, honesty). 
They are not capitalized. Proper nouns are always capitalized. They name specific people, places, and things
(Joe, Chicago, Academy Award).
A verb is a word or set of words that shows action (runs, is going, has been painting)
feeling (loves, envies); or state of being (am, are, is, have been, was, seem).
Examples:
He ran around the block.
I like my friend.
They seem friendly.
A subject is the noun, pronoun (see the "Pronouns" section later in this chapter),
or set of words that performs the verb.</p>
Examples:
The woman hurried.
